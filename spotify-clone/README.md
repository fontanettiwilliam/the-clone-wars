  The Music Player
</h3>


## :notes: Description
This is a simple clone of the famous Spotify music platform. An integrated login was made with Api from Spotify, in addition a home screen was created bringing real data of the user who is logged on such as: Name, Profile photo, Your Playlists, Your music and favorite artists. Unfortunately the song is not being played by our clone. Proem if you are listening in any other Spotify app, you can use this clone as a "remote control".
</br>
In the development, ContextApi, Reducer, Hooks, API connection and page routing system concepts were used.
For more information on libraries, see the section below.

Note: All material used for Spotify's visual identity must be used in accordance with the company's terms. To do this, check directly on their [website](https://developer.spotify.com/branding-guidelines/)

## :running: Run if you wish, you can.  Hmmmmmm.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
